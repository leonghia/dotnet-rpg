## Description

The .NET framework is getting better and better and more important in the web development world nowadays.

Almost every request I get for new web development projects is asking for knowledge in .NET, including Web API and Entity Framework.

So, knowing the fundamentals of back-end web development with .NET can be highly beneficial to your career. And that’s where this course comes in.

In a short period of time, you will learn how to set up a Web API, make restful calls to this Web API and also save data persistently with Entity Framework, Code-First Migration, a SQL Server database, and all three types of relationships in this database.

We will get right to the point, you will see every single step of writing the necessary code and by the end of this course, you will have what it takes to say ‘yes’ to all the .NET project requests from any recruiter.

The only tool you need in the beginning is Visual Studio Code which is available for free.

We will use Visual Studio Code for our implementations and make calls to the Web API with the help of Swagger UI - an interface that lets you consume the API out-of-the-box, thanks to the latest version of the .NET framework.

Later, we will also utilize SQL Server Express and the SQL Server Management Studio to manage our database. These are also available for free.

The back-end application we’re going to build is a small text-based role-playing game where different users can register (we’re going to use JSON web tokens for authentication) and create their own characters like a mage or a knight, add some skills and a weapon, and also let the characters fight against each other to see who is the best of them all.
